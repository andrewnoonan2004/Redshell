## Installation

> **Warning**
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable) and should not be used in production, try it in a VM for a while!

To rebase an existing Silverblue/Kinoite installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/andrewnoonan2004/redshell:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/andrewnoonan2004/redshell:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

This repository builds date tags as well, so if you want to rebase to a particular day's build:

```
sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/andrewnoonan2004/redshell:20230403
```

This repository by default also supports signing.

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.
## Description of the image
This image is heavily inspired by bluefin-dx, but with yaru theming removed as well as proprietary tools like VSCode. I also choose to include some utilities that I find useful in the base image that don't run well in Distrobox, such as powertop and intel gpu monitoring tools, and fish as the default shell.
